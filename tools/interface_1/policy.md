## Common Standards (applies to all SOPs)
- Validation: Halt with a clear error if required inputs are missing or invalid.  
- Authorization & Approvals: Enforce role-based access. Approvers can act without self-signoff unless SOP mandates another role.  
- Logging & Audit: Log every create/update/approve/reject/delete/execute.  
- Halt Conditions: Stop with clear messaging (and escalate if needed) when inputs, approvals, or external calls fail.  
- Data Minimization: Store only necessary audit context; avoid raw PII or full datasets.  
- Tool Usage: Use only provided toolsâ€”no invented steps or integrations.
