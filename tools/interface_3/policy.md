# Incident Management Policy (Client, User & Vendor Management)
The current time is 2025-09-25 12:00:00 UTC

## Common Standards (applies to all SOPs)
- Validation: Halt with a clear error if required inputs are missing or invalid.  
- Authorization & Approvals: Enforce role-based access. Approvers can act without self-signoff unless SOP mandates another role.  
- Logging & Audit: Log every create/update/approve/reject/delete/execute.  
- Halt Conditions: Stop with clear messaging (and escalate if needed) when inputs, approvals, or external calls fail.  
- Data Minimization: Store only necessary audit context; avoid raw PII or full datasets.  
- Tool Usage: Use only provided tools—no invented steps or integrations.

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### Incident Operations

**1\. Reporting Incidents**

Log incidents requiring formal management response.

**Authorized user role:** Incident managers, technical support, system administrators, vendor_contact, executives

Inputs:

- Required: title, category, severity, impact_level, urgency_level, client_id, component_id, reporter_user_id, detection_timestamp
- Optional: status (default: 'open'), assigned_to_user_id, resolution_timestamp

Steps:

- Verify the reporter user is active; as well, client and component exist.
- Classify severity using P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 evaluation rules.
- Confirm all required fields are provided.
- Create an incident record linked to the client/component using report_incident.
- Log an audit entry for the reported incident.

Halt conditions: Missing required fields; invalid user/client/component; severity not determined; creation failed

**Severity Classification Process while reporting incidents:**

Evaluate the following conditions and set the corresponding boolean flags (p1_\*, p2_\*, p3_\*) to True for every condition that applies based on the available data. Compute severity as P1 if any P1 condition is True; otherwise P2 if any P2 condition is True; otherwise P3 if any P3 condition is True; otherwise P4.

**P1 Evaluation:**

- Evaluate whether the incident causes complete outage of business-critical service with no workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts the entire enterprise or multiple customers with 5 or more affected parties.
- Evaluate whether the incident has significant regulatory, safety, or financial implications.
- Evaluate whether the incident involves a high-priority customer with contractual P1 requirements or is a recurrent incident.

**P2 Evaluation:**

- Evaluate whether the incident causes major degradation of business-critical services with a workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts multiple departments, sites, or critical business functions.
- Evaluate whether the incident risks breaching a high-priority SLA with significant impact.

**P3 Evaluation:**

- Evaluate whether the incident impacts a single department, localized users, or a non-critical function.
- Evaluate whether the incident causes moderate degradation with operations continuing using a minimal workaround.

If none of the P1/P2/P3 conditions apply, set severity as **P4**.

**2\. Updating Incident Status**

Modify status or progress details of active incidents.

**Authorized user role:** Incident managers, technical support, executive

Inputs:

- Obtain incident_id
- Change_set (such as status modification or fields that need updates)

Steps:

- Verify that the incident exists and the user has access.
- Confirm new status and other inputs are valid.
- Update the requested changes using update_incident.
- Create an incident updates record using log_incident_update.

Halt conditions: Incident not found; invalid status; insufficient permissions; update failed

**Subscription Tier Values and Metrics**

- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Support: 24/7/365

**2\. Standard Tier**

Target clients: Mid-market, important but less critical operations

- Resolution times: P1: 8-24 hr, P2: 24-48 hr, P3: 72-120 hr, P4: 168 hr
- Availability: 99.5% uptime
- Support: Business hours with on-call for critical issues

**3\. Basic Tier**

Target clients: Small businesses, standard operational needs

- Response times: P1: 4-8 hr, P2: 24 hr, P3: 48-72 hr, P4: 5-7 business days

- Availability: 99.0% uptime
- Support: Business hours only

**3\. Managing Incident Escalations**

Elevate response when severity, SLA breach, or resource issues occur.

**Authorized user role:** Incident managers, technical support, account managers, executive

Inputs:

- Required: incident_id, escalated_by_user, escalated_to_user, escalation_level, escalated_at (current timestamp)
- Optional: reason, status (default: 'active'), resolved_at (set once resolved)

Steps:

- Verify incident exists.
- Confirm the target user exists with a valid escalation role.
- Create an escalation record linked to the incident using submit_escalation.
- Update escalation status and return escalation_id.
- Log an audit entry for the newly submitted escalation.

Halt conditions: Incident not found; target user invalid; escalation failed

### Communication Management

**Authorized user role:** Incident managers, technical support

**Recording Communications**

Document stakeholder communications during incident response.

Inputs:

- Required: incident_id, sender_id, recipient_id, communication_type, delivery_method, delivery_status (default: 'pending')
- Optional:, recipient_type, sent_at (set to current timestamp, if delivery_status: 'sent')

Steps:

- Verify both incident and sender user exists.
- Confirm recipient exists or recipient_type is valid.
- Create a communication record linked to an incident using record_communication and return communication_id.
- Log audit entry for the recorded communication.

Halt conditions: Incident not found; invalid sender/recipient; missing required fields; creation failed

## Authority and Access Controls

**Permission Validation**

All operations enforce user authority based on:

- Role: incident_manager, technical_support, account_manager, executive, vendor_contact, system_administrator, client_contact
- Client association: user must be linked to the relevant client_id
- Vendor association: user must be linked to the relevant vendor_id
- Active status: user must be active in the users table
